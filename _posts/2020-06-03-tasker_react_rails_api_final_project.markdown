# Summary
When I sit down to work, I usually have several tasks that need to get done. An old fashioned to-do list is pretty good, but what I find is that I usually get stuck on one task and at the end of my work time, I haven't accomplished what I needed to get done that day. My husband and I came up with the idea of Tasker as a time management application, where you could input tasks and the amount of time you wanted to spend on each. Tasker would start a timer for each task, and alert you when it was time to move to the next task.

# Languages and Tools Used
Ruby, Ruby on Rails API, PostgreSQL, ActiveRecord, HTML, Semantic UI, React, Redux

***

# Features
* Created a React app using ES6 JavaScript, stateless components, and container components
* Implemented react-router for RESTful routing; Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change; and fetch requests to send and receive data from the API
* Utilized Rails API, ActiveRecord, PostgreSQL, and rendered JSON for back-end development

# Obstacles Encountered
Thanks to the great Globetrotter walkthrough video series available on Learn, I didn't encounter many obstacles.

The biggest issue I encountered was adapting my idea to something I could build in a short period of time. I was over ambitious in my desire to have users in my project, and that ate a lot of time I could have used to build the core components of the application. Earlier this week I realized that after months of working on the project, I had met all of the project requirements despite not having the ability to add tasks or run a timer (which were kind of the point.) I've decided to turn this project in with the intention of continuing to work on adding those features in the future.
# What's Next
* Adding an approximate start time to the List forms
* Adding CRUD capabilities to Tasks through the List form
* Creating a timer for each task based on the assigned amount of time available
* Adding check points to the List creation/edit forms to make sure the time assigned to tasks is not over or under the total work time.
* More items can be found in my DevLog for the project.

Thanks for reading.
