I graduated from a liberal arts college. In my collegiate career, I had been a published poet, a produced playwright, and awarded for both my poetry and playwriting both locally and nationally. I had no doubt that I would get into a graduate program or get a job straight out of college. I had been raised with the mentality that a college degree would open the gates to employment. 

I encountered a harsh reality after graduation, when I was unemployed for two years. I would send out two job applications a week for months, but no one wanted to hire a B.A. in English, and the companies for which I had previously worked, like Starbucks, no longer wanted to hire me because I was now overqualified. Family and friends made remarks labeling me as lazy, lacking work ethic, and posted comments on my social media feeds asking, "Isn't it time for you to get a job?" I developed housebound anxiety and was crippled by fear of outside criticism. 

Eventually, I was hired at a local tapas restaurant. I was ashamed to go back into food service, an industry I had worked in throughout high school and college, but I took stock in being employed. I later left that job to work an unarmed security position, then left that position after my husband and I moved to a different state. I applied for technical writing positions, hoping that my degree would get me a position in a more practical writing position, but the entry level positions required three years of experience I didn't have. I ended up substitute teaching at a private high school, until we moved to Indiana.

My husband, who had served in the Marines for five years, had worked in the tech field around programmers, and taught himself a couple coding languages, had worked in government contracting for two years before he decided to go back to school at Indiana University to study UX/UI. We both saw the move to Indiana as a reset button, and I started pursuing other career options. 

First, I thought I wanted to be a nurse. I applied to a nursing program at a community college, and was accepted, but I felt no joy when I saw my acceptance letter. I only felt dread. I decided that nursing was not the right career path for me, and in the meantime, I began working at a hotel in town. 

I liked several aspects of hospitality--the high demand for employees and the ability to find work in any city in the world was very appealing to me. Unfortunately, the work life balance was non-existent and for someone with a family, consistently working 10-14 hours multiple days a week lead me to the end of my rope. 

Hospitality was not working. While I have always been good for a job--I grew up on a farm, have always been an extremely hard worker, and can assimilate new skills very quickly--but I finally got to a point where I needed to find a job that was good *for me.*

I started thinking about and discussing with my husband what was important to me in a career as well as my strengths and weaknesses.

"You're not going to believe me, but I think you'd be a good back-end developer."

What? We had been friends with programmers. We went out to eat with people who wore those nerdy shirts with coding jokes that only programmers understood. One of our friends was the mad scientist of programmers--he would code all day and night and forget to sleep and eat, until we called to check on him. *I* was one of *them*? 

"I tried it. I just don't have the mind for it. You either get it or you don't." 

So I set about to find out if I was person who got it, or a person who didn't get it. 

I did some experimentation on Codecademy, completed lessons on Grasshopper, and started some courses on Udemy. 

I got it. 

I found the Flatiron School's Online Web Developer course on Instagram, and something clicked. I had heard of Flatiron years ago, because I have followed Karlie Kloss since I was a teenager and she was just starting her modeling career. I don't make it a habit of following the lives of celebrities, but Karlie had always lingered in the periphery. I had always taken an interest in her "Kode with Klossy" program, and had always been disappointed I was outside the age limit for the course. 

I had a hard time thinking this was just coincidence, so I did my research on the program, and one day I got an email about the "Women Take Tech" scholarship. I went to apply for the scholarship and unknowingly applied for the Online Web Developer program too. This was something I had planned to do, but I was still trying to summon the courage for.

Shortly after, I completed my interview and received my acceptance. And here I am! 

I am so excited to be here, taking this course through the Flatiron School, with like-minded individuals, who may have started careers in other fields and found their way here. 

And hey, in some weird twist of fate, Karlie Kloss and I will end up being alumnae from the same institution.
