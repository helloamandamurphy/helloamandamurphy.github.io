Oh hey! I'm Amanda.

Thanks for finding your way to my site. I thought I would do a quick introduction about myself before I start sharing technical posts.

I'm an online self-paced web development student at Flatiron School, a wife to a grad student, and a boy mom to a toddler and a Maine Coon cat.

I started studying code with Flatiron School in July 2018, after working in the service industry for eleven years, ranging from selling elephant ears at rodeos to working at a state favorite steakhouse to managing fifteen housekeepers at a hotel in downtown Indianapolis. 

I have a bachelors in creative writing, and am an awarded, published, and produced poet and playwright. These days most of my writing is for [Intercoastals ](https://theintercoastals.com/), an online publication I run with my husband, but I always have several projects on my mind and up my sleeve. I also [started my own photography business last year](https://theintercoastals.com/lilacwest), and it's a hobby / side hustle I really enjoy.

My husband, Ries, and I met and graduated from DePauw University, both as creative writing majors. We survived a five year Marine enlistment and a deployment together, and worked as defense contractors for a couple years before we decided to return to school.

Ries is studying Human-Computer Interaction and Design (HCI/d) at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana while I'm learning to code. We've almost always worked in the same field, but in different positions--we like being able to talk about work without ever being in competition. He graduates in May, so we're both applying to jobs this spring, and I can't wait to see where we end up.

Ries is actually the person who introduced me to programming. He had learned a couple languages when he was in the military and had several friends who were programmers. I had no idea what coding / programming was until early 2018. One day I came home from work and was telling him about my ideal job, and things I liked doing (which included my unnatural love for assembling IKEA furniture) and he said, "You're never going to believe it, but I think you might be a programmer."

After that, I began experimenting with code on Codecademy, Udemy, and Grasshopper and couple months later, I applied for a scholarship and admission to Flatiron School. When I got my admission email I cried. I didn't know much, but I knew it was a good fit.

Getting through the Flatiron School curriculum took me a long time as a stay at home mom with a working grad student as a husband, but it's without a doubt my greatest accomplishment--outside of making a tiny person, which was honestly, a lot less work. 

I am currently working on my final project (building a React application with a Rails API back-end) and I'll begin revising my resume and projects, creating a portfolio page, and applying to junior developer positions very soon.

Outside of writing code, some of my other interests include: non-toxic beauty, skin, and home products; story driven video games; holistic health and functional medicine; working out / movement in general; horror / crime fiction / thriller books; mythology, folklore, and ghost stories; digital comics; music; and Walt Disney World. 

If you want to know more about those interests, you should check out Intercoastals ([this article is a good starting point.](https://theintercoastals.com/articles/2020/1/13/about-us).)

I think that's all I can think of for now, but if you want to connect on other platforms, I'll leave my social links below.
